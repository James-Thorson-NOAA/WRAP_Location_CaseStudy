# WRAP_Location_CaseStudy
Simple simulation code to prepare for the WRAP Workshop March 23-25, 2020

1. OPERATING MODEL - SimulateWorld_Function.R: this is the function that generates temperature dependent species distribution and abundance

2. ESTIMATION MODELS - ModelComparison.R: this code uses the function above to generate data, then builds an example GAM and BRT model, and makes predictions into the future 2020-2080.
